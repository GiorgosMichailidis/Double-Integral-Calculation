# Double-Integral-Calculation

This notebook computes the solution of a double integral using three different methods:

1. Analytical calculation
2. Numerical calculation (Simpson's rule)
3. Monte Carlo calculation

Additionally, it includes:

1. Computation of the convergence of Simpson's rule
2. Distribution of results by Monte Carlo integration
3. Plotting of the surface of the integrated function

You can adjust the integrated function in every kernel.

This Python code was developed during the Computational Mathematics course as part of the master's program in Computational Physics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
